# Using shared settings between multiple environments in Angular üöÄ

## The problem üòï

When we create a new Angular project, by default Angular CLI creates two environment files for `development` and `production`.

But in real world software development workflow, we may need more custom environments (e.g. `staging`, `qa`). Moreover, there are some environmental variables that are common between these environments. For example, API URL to fetch data from server. Thus, we must find a way to share the base settings across all environments and override them as needed.

In this article, we are going to learn:

- How to add **custom** environments (e.g. `staging`)
- How we can share some **common** settings between environments

## Create a custom environment üíé

Open your Angular project and create a new file under `environments` folder. In this example, we create a new environment for staging (`environment.staging.ts` file).

> üîñ **TIP:** The name of the file should follow the naming convention:
>
> `environment.<your-env-name>.ts`

![Create new staging env file](./assets/staging-env.png)

Great, let's add some configuration in our new env file...

```ts
// environment.staging.ts

export const environment = {
  production: true,
  environmentName: "staging",
  apiUrl: "<your-api-url-here>",
};
```

## Update `angular.json` config file üëà

Once you have created the new environment file, you have to specify file replacements for different environments. In your `angular.json` file find the following paths:

- `projects.<your-project-name>.architect.build.configurations`
- `projects.<your-project-name>.architect.serve.configurations`

Update the sections as the following example:

```json
// angular.json

{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/@angular/cli/lib/config/schema.json",
  "version": 1,
  "newProjectRoot": "projects",
  "projects": {
    "<your-project-name>": {
      // ...

      "architect": {
        "build": {
          //...
          "configurations": {
            //...
            "staging": {
              "fileReplacements": [
                {
                  "replace": "src/environments/environment.ts",
                  "with": "src/environments/environment.staging.ts"
                }
              ]
            }
          }
        },
        "serve": {
          //...
          "configurations": {
            "staging": {
              "browserTarget": "<your-project-name>:build:staging"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## The problem is still out there üí•

Although we have created a new custom environment, in a typical project setup we may have duplication of environmental settings in which the values may be shared between them.

An example is depicted below where the API URL is common for all environments:

```ts
// environment.ts

export const environment = {
  production: false,
  environmentName: "development",
  apiUrl: "https://my-api.com/api", // common setting
};
```

```ts
// environment.prod.ts

export const environment = {
  production: true,
  environmentName: "production",
  apiUrl: "https://my-api.com/api", // common setting
};
```

```ts
// environment.staging.ts

export const environment = {
  production: true,
  environmentName: "staging",
  apiUrl: "https://my-api.com/api", // common setting
};
```

> In this example, the common settings is not a real problem, since there is only one shared value between the existing environments.
>
> But... Imagine a real world Angular project which has at least 4-5 environments and a bunch of settings that developers have to maintain. This is really a problem, believe me... üòüüò•

## Create a common environment üí¶üî•

Let‚Äôs make our life easy by using a base configuration file for common settings across all environments.

First, in your project create a new file with name `environment.common.ts` under the `environments` folder.

![Create new staging env file](./assets/common-env.png)

The next step is to add all base configuration in there...

```ts
// environment.common.ts

export const commonEnv = {
  production: false,
  environmentName: "development",
  apiUrl: "https://my-api.com/api",
};
```

Last step is to change the existing environment files by importing the common file and override only the necessary settings.

In this example we don't need to override anything for the default environment (`development`).

```ts
// environment.ts

import { commonEnv } from "./environment.common";

const env: Partial<typeof commonEnv> = {};

// Export all settings of common replaced by dev options
export const environment = Object.assign(commonEnv, env);
```

But, for `production` and `staging` we have to override some settings from the base.

```ts
// environment.prod.ts

import { commonEnv } from "./environment.common";

const env: Partial<typeof commonEnv> = {
  production: true,
  environmentName: "production",
};

// Export all settings of common replaced by dev options
export const environment = Object.assign(commonEnv, env);
```

```ts
// environment.staging.ts

import { commonEnv } from "./environment.common";

const env: Partial<typeof commonEnv> = {
  production: true,
  environmentName: "staging",
};

// Export all settings of common replaced by dev options
export const environment = Object.assign(commonEnv, env);
```

We use the `Object.assign()` method that allows you to copy all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object, and return the target object.

> üîñ **Advanced Tip**
>
> Instead of `Object.assign()` method, you can use the spread operator.
>
> ```ts
> export const environment = { ...commonEnv, ...env };
> ```
>
> As an alternative, if you have more advanced setting with nested properties, I recommend to use `merge` function from [lodash](https://lodash.com/) library.
>
> ```ts
> export const environment = _.merge(commonEnv, env);
> ```

There is one more extremely useful trick here to preserve typings with typescript.
We use `Partial<typeof commonEnv>` in order to help us to track the properties of the common environment and override them correctly.

## Use environment settings inside project ‚ú®

Great! We have created multiple environments and now is time to use them in our project.

You can import environment settings in your services/components like the following example:

```ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { environment } from "src/environments/environment"; // here is the import

@Component({
  selector: "app-root",
  templateUrl: "./app.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./app.component.css"],
})
export class AppComponent {
  private apiUrl: string;

  constructor() {
    this.apiUrl = environment.apiUrl;
    // ...
  }
}
```

Please be careful! **Don't import** your settings from the direct environment file!

For example:

```ts
// DO NOT
import { environment } from "src/environments/environment.staging";

// DO
import { environment } from "src/environments/environment";
```

> ‚ùó **Attention**
>
> We saw how to import environment settings in our project...
> But it's **NOT** good idea to import them directly at your components or services.
>
> I suggest to create a new Angular service (e.g. `ConfigService`) and handle all settings from there by injecting it in your components.
> Thus, you will have a cleaner and more maintainable code.

## Run/Build your project üì¶

We are reaching the end, the hard work is done!
Now it's time to run and build your application for targeted environment by specific `--configuration` parameter with Angular CLI.

In order to build our application in `staging` mode, run one of the following commands:

```sh
# Builds and serves your app, rebuilding on file changes.
$ ng serve --configuration staging
```

```sh
# Compiles an Angular app into an output directory
$ ng build --configuration staging
```

## Conclusion ‚úÖ

Hooray! We‚Äôre done!

I hope you enjoyed this guide and will make your applications even more clean and maintainable by splitting environments to separate reusable configuration files! This approach can help in an excellent way in the enterprise organization setting!
