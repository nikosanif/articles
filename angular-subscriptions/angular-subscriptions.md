# [4+1 ways] How to Unsubscribe from Observables in Angular like a ðŸ˜Ž

## The Problem :thinking:

TODO: describe the problem

In a nutshell, we will use:

- the `async` Angular build-in pipe
- RxJS operators (e.g `takeUntil`)
- custom array of subscriptions
- the `SubSink` npm package
- the `@ngneat/until-destroy` npm package

## 1. The `async` Pipe

As we know Angular provide us a lot of built-in functionalities that we don't have to worry about by choosing third-party libraries (that's why we love :heart: Angular after all, right?). Such a very useful functionality is the `async` pipe.

Looking at the [official documentation](https://angular.io/api/common/AsyncPipe), we will see the following description:

> _The `async` pipe subscribes to an **Observable** or **Promise** and returns the latest value it has emitted. When a new value is emitted, the `async` pipe marks the component to be checked for changes. When the component gets destroyed, the `async` pipe unsubscribes automatically to avoid potential memory leaks._

Example:

```ts
// async-example.component.ts

import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { interval } from 'rxjs';
import { tap } from 'rxjs/operators';
import { Logger } from '../utils/logger';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-async-example',
  templateUrl: './async-example.component.html',
})
export class AsyncExampleComponent {
  private logger = new Logger(AsyncExampleComponent.name);

  obs1$ = interval(1000).pipe(
    tap((value) => {
      this.logger.log('sub1', value);
    })
  );
  obs2$ = interval(1000).pipe(
    tap((value) => {
      this.logger.log('sub2', value);
    })
  );
  obs3$ = interval(1000).pipe(
    tap((value) => {
      this.logger.log('sub3', value);
    })
  );

  constructor() {}
}
```

```html
<!-- async-example.component.html -->

<p>Observable 1 value: {{obs1$ | async}}</p>
<p>Observable 2 value: {{obs2$ | async}}</p>
<p>Observable 3 value: {{obs3$ | async}}</p>

<!-- Pro Tip -->
<ng-container *ngIf="obs1$ | async as val1">
  <p>Observable 1 value: {{val1}}</p>
</ng-container>
```

As we can see in the above example, during the creation of the component, 3 observables are initialized which emit values every 1 second using `interval` operator from RxJs.

At the same time we can see that these observables are piped with `async` to the template. This means that they will automatically `subscribe` during initialization and `unsubscribe` during component destruction. This constitutes a big advantage, because we do not bother to do it ourselves through code.

## 2. RxJs Operators

If you have experience in Angular, you already know that RxJs (one of the core packages) has a lot of power. Thus, one more time it provides us a lot of useful operators that help us to to unsubscribe from subscriptions.

Firstly, let's look at some definitions with what we will use:

- **Subject**: A `Subject` is a special type of Observable which shares a single execution path among observers. You can think of this as a single speaker talking at a microphone in a room full of people. Their message (the subject) is being delivered to many (multicast) people (the observers) at once. This is the basis of multicasting. Typical observables would be comparable to a 1 on 1 conversation.
- **interval**: An operator that returns an observable which emits numbers in sequence based on provided timeframe.
- **takeUntil**: A filtering operator that emits values until provided observable emits.

Example:

```ts
// take-until-example.component.ts

import { Component, OnDestroy, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { interval, Subject } from 'rxjs';
import { takeUntil } from 'rxjs/operators';
import { Logger } from '../utils/logger';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-take-until-example',
  templateUrl: './take-until-example.component.html',
})
export class TakeUntilExampleComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  private logger = new Logger(TakeUntilExampleComponent.name);
  private unsubscribe$ = new Subject<void>();

  constructor() {}

  ngOnInit() {
    interval(1000)
      .pipe(takeUntil(this.unsubscribe$))
      .subscribe((value) => {
        this.logger.log('sub1', value);
      });
    interval(1000)
      .pipe(takeUntil(this.unsubscribe$))
      .subscribe((value) => {
        this.logger.log('sub2', value);
      });
    interval(1000)
      .pipe(takeUntil(this.unsubscribe$))
      .subscribe((value) => {
        this.logger.log('sub3', value);
      });
  }

  ngOnDestroy() {
    this.unsubscribe$.next();
    this.unsubscribe$.complete();
  }
}
```

Now let us look in detail at the above example step by step:

- First of all, we initialize a new `Subject` which does not emit any data type (`void`).
- Then we created 3 observables with the help of `interval` operator.
- We pass to these the `takeUntil` operator as pipe in order to filter values until the `unsubscribe$` emits.
- Last but not least step is to trigger `unsubscribe$` during the `ngOnDestroy`. We call `.next()` method to trigger new value emission and `.complete()` to automatically unsubscribe all the observers.

Although we used only the `takeUntil` operator, there are other which can help us, too. For example we can use:

- **take**: It emits provided number of values before completing. You can use it when you are interested in only the first emission, you want to use `take`. Maybe you want to see what the user first clicked on when they entered the page, or you would want to subscribe to the click event and just take the first emission.
- **takeWhile**: It emits values until provided expression is false. You can use it when the optional inclusive parameter is set to true it will also emit the first item that didn't pass the predicate.

## 3. Custom Array of Subscriptions

Another way to unsubscribe a `Subscription` is to put them in an array. So we can iterate all items and call the `.unsubscribe()` method for each item in this array during component destruction.

Example:

```ts
// custom-array-example.component.ts

import { Component, OnDestroy, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { interval, Subscription } from 'rxjs';
import { Logger } from '../utils/logger';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-custom-array-example',
  templateUrl: './custom-array-example.component.html',
})
export class CustomArrayExampleComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  private logger = new Logger(CustomArrayExampleComponent.name);
  private subs: Subscription[] = [];

  constructor() {}

  ngOnInit() {
    const sub1 = interval(1000).subscribe((value) => {
      this.logger.log('sub1', value);
    });
    this.subs.push(sub1);

    const sub2 = interval(1000).subscribe((value) => {
      this.logger.log('sub2', value);
    });
    this.subs.push(sub2);

    const sub3 = interval(1000).subscribe((value) => {
      this.logger.log('sub3', value);
    });
    this.subs.push(sub3);
  }

  ngOnDestroy() {
    this.subs.forEach((s) => s.unsubscribe());
  }
}
```

This method works very well with multiple subscriptions without any third-party library. However, there are 3 important disadvantages:

- We need to initialize an extra variable in the component
- For each new `Subscription` we must add it to the array
- We must not forget to iterate the array and unsubscribe its items at `ngOnDestroy`

## 5. `@ngneat/until-destroy` npm package
